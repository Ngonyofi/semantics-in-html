<legend><h3>Semantics in HTML</h3></legend>

<p><span>&#128073</span>In HTML,for example, the <strong> h 1 </strong>element, is a 
  semantic element which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of 
   "a top level heading on your page."
</p>

<p><span>&#9658</span>  Here is a top level heading</p>
 
<p><span>&#128073</span> By default, most brower's user agent stylesheet will style h1 with a large front
size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like 
anything you wanted). On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top
level heading
</p>
       
<p><span>&#9658</span>Consider the following</p>

<p>
 <span>&#8680</span>  This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no sematic
value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is 
therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.
</p>

<p><span>&#8680</span>  
   HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and 
not and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentaton 
(how it should look) is sole responsibility of CSS.

<h5>Some of the benefits from writing Sematic Markup are as follows:</h5>
</legend>
<ul>
<li>Search engines will consider its contens as important keywords
to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)</li>
<li>Sreen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users
 navigate a page</li>
<li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easierthan searching though endless divs with or without sematic or 
namedspaced classes</li>
<li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
<li>Sematic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>
</ul>

 <h3>SEO</h3>
 </legend>
 
<p><span>&#11088</span>SEO (Search Engine Optimimization) is a process of making a website more
 visible in seach results, also termed improving search</p>

<p><span>&#11088</span> Search engines<em>crawl</em> the web, following links from page <br> to page, and index the content
  found. When you reach, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers following
  rules. If you follow those closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the the best
  chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue
  <i>(for ecommerce and ads)</i>
</p>

<p>
Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking
as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, emmpirical knowledge
from science papers or patents.
